Extracts business-scenarios events from a HTTP request event series.

A business scenario event is built based on a succession of multiple HTTP requests, that are
landing on the server within the context of the same HTTP session, identified by the
"JSESSIONID" cookie.

A business scenario is started by a
specific request and ended by other specific request.
