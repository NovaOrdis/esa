Extracts business-scenarios events from a HTTP request event series.

A business scenario is a succession of inter-related HTTP requests, issued by the same user,
in order to achieve a well defined result. An example of business scenario, for a banking
application is login, navigate to the checking account status page, and display the details
of the last transaction.

From a performance measurement tool, a scenario is defined as the succession of the HTTP requests
received by the server in the context of the same HTTP session, as identified by the "JSESSIONID"
cookie, between two special "marked" requests. The load testing generator can usually easy mark
request by using custom headers.
