Turns the event stream into human-readable text lines that are sent it to the default output queue.
Each event is converted into a separate line.

Usage:

    esa [out] -o|--output-format="<output-format>"

where <output-format> can be assembled using event property names. If the event does not contain
a specified property, or if it does not have a value for it, the output is the empty string.

Example:

   esa out -o "timestamp, request-path, request-query, status-code, response-time"
