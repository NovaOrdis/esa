Turns the event stream into human-readable text. Each event produces its own separate text line.

Usage:

    esa [output] -o|--output-format="<output-format>"

where <output-format> can be assembled using event property names. If the event does not contain
a specified property, or if it does not have a value for it, the output is the empty string. If
the property is a Map, the following notation can be used:

    map-property-name.key-name

"describe" command introspects events and shows their property names.

Example:

   esa < ./log-file.log [global-options] -o "timestamp, request-path, request-query, status-code, response-time"

Also see:

    describe command
