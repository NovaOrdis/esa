Turns the event stream into human-readable, comma separated value text. Each event produces its
own separate text line.

Usage:

    esa [output] [-o|--output-format="<output-format>"]

Note that -o|--output-format is not required, the stream processor is capable of introspecting
the events and inferring output fields (usually timestamp and properties). However, <output-format>
can be used to enforce a specific output format. It is usually assembled using event property
names. If the event does not contain a specified property, or if it does not have a value for it,
the output for that property will be the empty string.

The event's timestamp can be specified as "timestamp".

If the property is a Map, the following notation can be used:

    map-property-name.key-name

"describe" command introspects events and shows their property names.

Example:

   esa < ./log-file.log [global-options] -o "timestamp, request-path, request-query, status-code, response-time"

    describe command
