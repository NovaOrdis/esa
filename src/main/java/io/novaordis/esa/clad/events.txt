events ${version}

Reads, parses and processes timed events. Usage:

    events < input-file.log -i|--input-format="..." <command> <command-options>

The input format is required and it must be specified either on command line or in the associated
configuration file. Common input formats are httpd log formats, CSV header definitions or garbage
collection log formats. Examples:

  httpd log format:  "%h %u [%t] \"%r\" \"%q\" %{c,JSESSIONID} %{i,Some-Request-Header} %s %b %D"
  CSV format:        "timestamp, count, status-code"

'events' will try to apply heuristics and figure out what type of format was specified.
