events ${version}

Reads, parses and processes timed event series.

Syntax: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    events < input-file.log <input-format-spec> <command> <command-options>

The input format  must be  specified either on command line,  in  an auxiliary file  or  in the
configuration file. For more details, see the "Input Format" section. More details about commands
and their options are available in the "Commands" section.

Commands: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@COMMANDS@
To get more details on a specific command, run:

    events --help <command-name>


Input Formats: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The input stream format is required. It can be specified either on command line with:

    -i|--input-format="..."

where the input format is specified in-line, or with:

    --input-format-file=<file-name-that-contains-input-format>

where the input format is defined in the file name referred by the command line option.

Common input formats are  httpd log,  CSV header definitions or  garbage collection log formats.
Examples:

  httpd log format:  "%h %u [%t] \"%r\" \"%q\" %{c,JSESSIONID} %{i,Some-Request-Header} %s %b %D"
  CSV format:        "timestamp, count, status-code"

'events' will try to apply heuristics and figure out what type of format was specified.  For more
 details about input formats, see "Input Formats" section below.

httpd Input Format

  When specified on command line, quotes need to be escaped: \"%r\". When specified in a format
  file, quotes do need to be escaped. HTTP special characters can also be used (&quot;).

  %A - The local IP address.
  %b - Response entity body size. Stored as long.
  %D - The time taken to serve the request. WildFly logs the time in milliseconds for %D, while
       Apache httpd logs the time in microseconds for the same %D.
  %h - Remote host name or IP address. Will log the IP address if HostnameLookups is set to Off,
       which is the default.
  %I - The name of the thread processing the request. Note that this is actually the WildFly
       convention, not Apache httpd convention (Apache httpd logs "bytes received, including
       request and headers" for %I)
  %l - Remote logname from identd (if supplied).
  %u - Remote user if the request was authenticated. May be irrelevant if return status (%s) is
       401 (unauthorized).
  %q - The query string, excluding the '?' character. Usually enclosed in quotes.
  %r - First line of request. Note that the first line is enclosed in quotes, you must explicitly
       specify the \" (double quotes) or ' (single quote) format elements.
  %s - The status code of the original request (whether was internally redirected or not). Stored
       as integer.
  %>s - The status code of the final request (whether was internally redirected or not). Stored as
       integer.
  %S - Bytes transferred (received and sent), including request and headers.
  %t - Time the request was received, in the format [18/Sep/2015:19:18:28 -0400]. The last number
       indicates the timezone offset from GMT. Usually the timestamp format specification is
       explicitly declared between brackets, but if the brackets are not present in the log format
       specification, they are implied: WildFly will enclose the generated timestamp between
       brackets.
  %T - Time taken to process the request, in seconds.
  %v - The local server name.

  The parser can be instructed to drop the log values for certain fields, by using the %?
  format string:

  %? - Instructs the parser to ignore (drop) the corresponding value.

CSV Input Format

The CSV input format consists in comma separated header names, with optional type and format
information. If not type or format information are specified, the input fields are handled as
strings. The general syntax is:

  <field-name>(<type>[:format])

Examples:

  path - the content of the field be read verbatim and handled as string.

  timestamp(time:yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss,SSS) - the content of the field will be parsed as time
  information according to the format specified between (time:...). The format follows Java
  SimpleDateFormat conventions. If the content cannot be converted into a time stamp, a FaultEvent
  will be generated and sent down the pipeline. For more details see:
  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html

  status-code(int) - the content of the field will be interpreted as integer and parsed
  accordingly. If the content cannot be converted to an integer, a FaultEvent will be generated
  and sent down the pipeline.

  body-size(long) - the content of the field will be interpreted as long and parsed accordingly.
  If the content cannot be converted to a long, a FaultEvent will be generated and sent down the
  pipeline.
