Extract business-scenarios events from a HTTP request event series and generate a CSV series
with one business scenario information per line.

A business scenario is a succession of inter-related HTTP requests, issued by the same user,
in order to achieve a business result. An example of business scenario for a banking application
is login, navigate to the checking account status page, and display the details of the last
transaction.

From a performance measurement tool, a scenario is defined as the succession of the HTTP requests
received by the server in the context of the same HTTP session, as identified by the "JSESSIONID"
cookie, between two specially marked requests. The load testing generator can usually easy mark
request by using custom headers.

Usage:

    events < input-file [global-options] business-scenario [business-scenario-options]

Example:

    events < access_log.log --input-format-file=./access_log.def business-scenario

Business Scenario Command Options:

    --stats - Generate a brief summary (counts, failure types, etc.), instead of a CSV series.

    --ignore-faults - By default, all faults (invalid HTTP requests) that are detected are
      reported at stdout interspersed with business scenario output. This mode is useful when
      inspecting data, as any errors in the input file are quickly made obvious. In order to
      suppress fault output, use "--ignore-faults".
