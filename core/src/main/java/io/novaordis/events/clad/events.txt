events < input-file.log [global-options] <input-format-spec> <command> [command-options]

The input format  must be  specified either on command line,  in  an auxiliary file  or  in the
configuration file. For more details, see the "Input Format" section. More details about commands
and their options are available in the "Commands" section.

Global Options: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Global options apply to all commands.

 --ignore-faults - by default, all faults (input lines that cannot be parsed into events) being
     detected are reported at stdout interspersed with the regular output. This mode is useful
     when inspecting data, as any input errors are quickly made obvious. In order to suppress
     fault reporting, use "--ignore-faults".

 --from=<from-timestamp>. If specified, all events preceding <from-timestamp> will be discarded
     and not sent to the command. For more details on the timestamp syntax, see the "Timestamps"
     section.

 --to=<to-timestamp>. If specified, all events preceding <from-timestamp> will be discarded
     and not sent to the command.

Command Line Argument Timestamps: ----------------------------------------------------------------

The default timestamp format is "MM/dd/yy HH:mm:ss" ("07/25/16 14:00:00"). No quotation marks are
necessary around the timestamp, the parser expects the space between the date and the time
sections and knows how to handle with it without quotes. However, quotes are handled correctly if
present. The following forms are equivalent:

    --from=07/25/16 14:00:00
    --from="07/25/16 14:00:00"

A shorter version is allowed, if the date portion of the timestamp is not specified, then the
HH:mm:ss timestamp can be used. It will be assumed to be relative to the date of the first timed
event seen by the parser, so this won't work if the time window spans more than a day. Example:

    --from=14:00:00
